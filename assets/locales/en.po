We disassociate your payment information with your Lantern Pro account. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing Lantern server IP address associated with the connection timestamp, or session duration. Given a specific Lantern Pro account, Lantern is technically unable to associate the Lantern account with the real identity of the user. Given a Lantern IP address and a precise time-stamp, Lantern is technically unable to attribute this IP address to a Lantern user or a Lantern user IP address."
